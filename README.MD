Hi Guys,

I attached a simple server file to reterieve the dependency tree without any optimizations.

I removed the frontend component for now, because I didn't want to distract with those hook shenanigans. 

Thank you for meeting me Sunday morning, I don't think I will schedule an interview at that time in the future. :)

Thank you,

Daniel
